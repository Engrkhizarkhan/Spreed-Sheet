# Dynamic Spreadsheet with Formula Parsing

This project implements a dynamic spreadsheet application that supports mathematical operations, custom functions, and cell references.

## Features
- Mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Built-in spreadsheet functions such as sum, average, median, etc.
- Support for cell references and ranges (e.g., A1, B2:C5).
- Real-time formula evaluation and updates when cell values change.
- Responsive UI grid to simulate a spreadsheet environment.
  
## Formulas
   - sum
   - average
   - median
   - even
   - someeven
   - everyeven
   - firsttwo
   - lasttwo
   - has2
   - increment
   - random

   - To apply formula use the formate of =sum(A1:B54).
   
## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the application.

## Usage
1. Enter a mathematical formula or function starting with '=' in any cell (e.g., =A1+B2, =SUM(A1:A5)).
2. The application will evaluate the formula and display the result in the corresponding cell.
